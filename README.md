### Data
The data that accompanies the code includes voxelized version of mandible (jaw) bones collected from the 
MICCAI 2015 segmentation challenge [1], 
Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) [2], 
and samples released by Wallner et al [3].
The submisison also made use of 48 more mandible samples, which are not included here, but can be accessed through 
data sharing agreements (please contact authors for further instructions).
 
 
 To download the data and set environment variables, please run 
 
     source download-data.sh
     
 You can also download the data separately [here](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1GCslF1eo6Bz2EK207CvBfRDUReb_dyXi).
 Please set the environment variable `$MANDIBLE_DATA_PATH`  to the data directory.
 
 ### Training and Testing
This is a python3 implementation. 
To install the requirements, depending on your preferred package manager, please run:
    
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt    
    or
    conda install --file requirements.txt
  

To train the model on the training subset, run the script 

    bash train-test.sh
    
To test your model on the test subset, set the `--test` flag in the `train-test.sh` script to `true`.
